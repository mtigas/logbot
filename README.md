Constant work-in-progress.

This is a simple Python-based log bot that tracks #opennews on
[IRC.Mozilla][http://irc.mozilla.org/].

This bot runs persistently on an EC2 server (in a `screen` session because of
laziness), with a minutely cron job that runs the `s3dir.py` utility to upload
the logs to S3:

```shell
# m h  dom mon dow   command
  * *  *   *   *     python /home/ubuntu/logbot/s3dir.py >> /home/ubuntu/s3log.txt
```

The S3 bucket is configured to use “website mode” and given the
[opennews-irc.yu8.in][http://opennews-irc.yu8.in/] CNAME.

That’s it.

(The archive is occasionally pulled down from the server and also stored right
in this repo — `/logs/` — as a backup. Yay.)
